About the Project
This project is a Todo List API developed using Node.js. This API is based on the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) structure, allowing users to add, edit, list, and delete tasks.

The API is built with Express.js. Database integration with MongoDB and user authentication with JWT are planned and currently under development.

Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: A web framework used to build the API structure.
Developer Notes
While developing this API, I gained in-depth knowledge of building RESTful API structures with Node.js. I focused on ensuring that CRUD operations are performed securely and efficiently, and that each function works optimally.
